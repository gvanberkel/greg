# Flicker 

*What is Flicker?:* ***Application development patterns for boring Flutter applications***  

I think Flicker is an anti pattern package in that it is designed to abstract away a lot of Flutter's beautiful implementation agnostic flexiblity. Flicker's goal is to expose some patterns that make enterprise style app development easiy.
