# TruckFuelNet

*What is TruckFuelNet?:* ***Diesel retailer with a 'technology enabled' edge in the market***  

TruckFuelNet is a broker business that connects Fuel stations with Fleet owners via a software platform. The software platform in 2007 was initially built solely by myself and it was also Code Collective's first project. In 2021 TFN has a a team of over 10 developers that enable their software endevours and they sell over 35 million litres of fuel per month (via their software platforms).

I have been resonsible for technology development on the TFN platform since 2007 and continue to own the technology delivery for the platform.
